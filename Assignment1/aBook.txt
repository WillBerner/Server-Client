For testing reading a text file

All output should be written to standard output (stdout). Your program should format its output exactly as shown
above. Your program should terminate when it reaches the end of the input file (for example, when control-D is
typed from the keyboard under UNIX). Your program must not output any user prompts, debugging information,
status messages, extra white spaces, etc. Your outputs will be graded by comparing with a pre-generated output
and any of these “extras” that your program outputs will incur a penalty in the grade.
The purpose of this assignment is to get up to speed with protocol message parsing and the use of Linux program
development tools. Note that, in the abstract, this assignment has nothin`g to do with networking and is just a
simple text parsing problem. This assignment is, however, a useful first step in writing an HTTP protocol parser
that must adhere to standards strictly.
